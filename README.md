# README

## Welcome to My Data Analysis Projects Repository

This repository is dedicated to showcasing a variety of data analysis projects that I have undertaken, focusing on different aspects of data science, including but not limited to:

- Time Series Analysis
- Probability Distribution
- Sales Analysis
- Web Scraping

As I continue to explore and expand my knowledge in the field of data analysis, I will be adding more projects regularly. Stay tuned for updates!

## Project Highlights

### 1. Time Series Analysis
Explore projects that involve analyzing time-dependent data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and forecasting future values.

### 2. Probability Distribution
Delve into projects that demonstrate various probability distributions, helping to understand data behavior and make informed decisions.

### 3. Sales Analysis
Examine sales data to uncover insights, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and drive business strategies.

### 4. Web Scraping
Learn how to extract data from websites using web scraping techniques, enabling the collection of real-time information for analysis.

## Libraries and Tools Used

In my projects, I utilize a range of powerful libraries and tools that enhance the data analysis process:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
